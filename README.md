# Resources

* [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

    I used this site to better understand flexbox. I realize my use of flexbox might be kind of redundant with the media queries, but I'm trying to get some flexbox time under my belt.

* [CSS Transitions](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp)

    Sometimes I need to check the proper construction of transitions. I specifically needed to reference how to make sure the transition reversed when the mouse no longer hovered over the element. I realized you need to put the transition timing and timing function on the element itself, not on the hover pseudo element.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

    I used Google Fonts for all the type on my page.

* [Pizza Planet Logo](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f7/07/4c/f7074c17d58aaf61d343267039e0e9f9.jpg)

    I used this image to construct my own version of the Pizza Planet logo.

* [Pizza Planet Martian](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/a/ae/Alien.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110220175306)

    I used this image to make a Pizza Planet sticker.

    I used this image to make the cheese texture.

# Comments

As you saw from my presentation on Tuesday, I had most of my site complete. Because I was reading the instructions for the prototype, I didn't get down to "project setup" and didn't see the instructions regarding the repo. I should've created a repo and had more commits as I went along, but this didn't occur to me until I was getting ready to turn the project in and had to clean up the code. I just wanted to explain why there were so few commits.
